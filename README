developed from (old) 1.9.3 trunk, pre 1.9 may not work

for personal reasons this bot is mostly bilingual (english y espa√±ol).

Notebot
This is a ruby bot that keeps community notes. The entire community can search through dictionaries, which are edited by authors, and created/maintained by admins. admins also give author/admin access, and can ban users as necessary.


-- this project needs documentation, both online (here) and in the bot!

Instructions
To get up and running, it should suffice to follow these instructions:

1. get it
2. cd notebot/
3. directory structure
mkdir dictionaries
mkdir dictionaries_conf
4. initial connection conf
edit lib/notebot.rb.
change the @@irc line:
change server to your preferred server (default to freenode)
change the bot's nick to your choice of nick
change the channels list to your choice of channel
5. connect independently to that channel withe the account you want to be its admin
6. ./notebot.rc
copy the generated uuid from STDOUT .. it looks something like this:
Notebot: generated uuid: 055eef81-12e3-41e3-a2d6-e57561fe0c8c
7. in the channel, issue the command: !_register <generated uuid>
this can only be done (successfully) one time for each program launch, so there's a limited need to worry about the one_time_pass
8. save the accounts data with your name now registered as admin. either restart the bot or issue: !_write_users
9. create your first dictionary and entry and read it back: 
!_new <name>
!+<name> test testing.
?<name> test

At any time you can safely exit the program with control-C, hooks are built in to save data sanely before exit.
