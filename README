developed from (old) 1.9.3 trunk, pre 1.9 may not work

for personal reasons this bot is mostly bilingual (english y espa√±ol).

Notebot
This is a ruby bot that keeps community notes. The entire community can search through dictionaries, which are edited by authors, and created/maintained by admins. admins also give author/admin access, and can ban users as necessary.


-- this project needs documentation, both online (here) and in the bot!
